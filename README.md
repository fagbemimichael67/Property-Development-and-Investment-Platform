# Property Development and Investment Platform

A comprehensive blockchain-based system for fractional real estate development investment, built on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity smart contracts.

## Overview

This platform enables transparent, decentralized property development investment through five interconnected smart contracts that manage the entire lifecycle from project creation to investor distributions.

## System Architecture

### Core Contracts

1. **Property Registry (`property-registry.clar`)**
    - Manages property project registration and metadata
    - Tracks development phases and milestones
    - Handles regulatory compliance and permit status

2. **Investment Manager (`investment-manager.clar`)**
    - Facilitates fractional ownership through tokenization
    - Manages investor contributions and ownership percentages
    - Handles crowdfunding mechanics and investment limits

3. **Development Tracker (`development-tracker.clar`)**
    - Monitors construction progress and milestone completion
    - Tracks development costs and budget allocation
    - Manages contractor payments and expense verification

4. **Distribution Engine (`distribution-engine.clar`)**
    - Automates profit distributions based on milestones
    - Calculates returns based on ownership percentages
    - Handles rental income and sale proceeds distribution

5. **Governance Controller (`governance-controller.clar`)**
    - Manages voting on key project decisions
    - Handles dispute resolution mechanisms
    - Controls emergency functions and contract upgrades
